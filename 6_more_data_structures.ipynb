Linked list are opposite to lists, they are faster while insertion and deletion of items while a bit slow on reading items.

    "A queue is the opposite of a stack: it’s FIFO—first in, first out—like a ticket line where the earliest arrival is served first. Use a queue when order of arrival matters. Both stacks and queues can share underlying implementations (arrays or linked lists), but queues add at the back and remove from the front, while stacks add and remove from the top. A good stack analogy is a YouTube upload list: the latest video sits on top and is accessed first."
