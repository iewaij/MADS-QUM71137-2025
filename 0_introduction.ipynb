    "- The University of Nottingham Ningbo China, BSc Economics\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start cutting through datasets like a master chef, you need sharp tools. Setting up your environment properly will save hours of pain later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the kitchen knife of data science. Get it set up right, and everything else becomes smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is like a Swiss-army knife. It installs Python *and* manages packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Install**: Get [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) for a lightweight start.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Good for scientific packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) that are tricky to compile.\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda create -n myenv python=3.12\n",
    "  conda activate myenv\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`uv` is the new kid on the block — super fast, minimal, and built in Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Install**: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`\n",
    "- **Pros**: Lightning-fast installs, works smoothly with modern Python packaging (like `pyproject.toml`).\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  uv venv myenv\n",
    "  source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "  uv add numpy pandas\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments isolate projects and ensures collaborators use the same packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each environment has its own Python and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n nlp_project python=3.13\n",
    "conda activate nlp_project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster, cleaner, and integrates with `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv venv .venv\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll spend hours here — choose wisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VS Code**: The most popular, great extensions for Python, Jupyter, linting.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: Notebook-centric, interactive exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are your **lab journals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VS Code notebooks**: Integrated editing and version control.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: More features, tabbed interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best for: quick experiments, EDA (exploratory data analysis), presentations.\n",
    "Worst for: large, production-ready projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatter and Linter\n",
    "\n",
    "Code that looks consistent is easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ruff**: Swiss-knife. Very fast, does both formatting and linting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run them in VS Code automatically on save.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run A Python Program\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever wonder *why* your loop didn’t run or *where* your variable disappeared? [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) shows your code execution step by step.\n",
    "Perfect for debugging logic, recursion, or nested loops."

    "## On AI and Vibe Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI assistants**: (like Copilot, ChatGPT, or Cursor) can autocomplete and suggest fixes. They’re your sous-chefs — fast, but don’t always complete the whole project for you.\n",
    "- **Vibe coding**: Sometimes you just write, experiment, and let the flow guide you. In notebooks, this feels natural. But — always come back and clean up.\n",
    "- **Learn coding**: You can simply ask the chatbot \"Teach me basic NumPy operations interactively\". Here is a template for you from [CS221](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2025/assignments/hw1_foundations/index.html), but feel free to use your own:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Teach me basic NumPy operations. Keep the session ~15–20 minutes and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines\n",
    "- Adjust difficulty: if I miss 2 in a row → slow + simpler; if I get 2 quickly → a bit harder or add a twist.\n",
    "- Use tiny, deterministic examples (small numbers, short tables, brief ASCII diagrams, code blocks). Show actual *run-throughs* (step-by-step states) if helps.\n",
    "- Use Code if it clarifies: ≤2 Python/NumPy blocks, each ≤20 lines; ideally no imports beyond `import numpy as np`.\n",
    "- Do NOT solve graded work. If I paste any, refuse and make a similar practice item.\n",
    "- Be CONCISE. Don't make notation complicated/unnecessary. Focus on intuitions. Code blocks should be short with simple variable names.\n",
    "- I may interrupt and ask to start somewhere else. Simply adjust and adapt from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested flow (flexible; use judgment)\n",
    "1) Start by explaining the topic in a few simple, but technically accurate sentences (explain core idea (≤6 sentences): intuition + minimal notation + why it matters + one common pitfall). Use basic notations and visualizations if necessary (CS221 requires basic math/programming backgrounds). For topics about programming, OK to start with concise code blocks.\n",
    "2) Quick check-in (≤1–2 min): ask 2 short questions about prior exposure and specific goal.\n",
    "3) Exercises: use a tiny instance and show intermediate states. Give exercises that build on each other. OK to give multiple exercises at the same time.\n",
    "   - e.g., for graph search: a 4–5 node weighted graph; show the frontier/priority-queue after each of 2–3 steps and which edges relax.\n",
    "   - for DP/MDP/RL/Logic/ML, do an equivalently small, concrete step-by-step trace.\n",
    "   - If code clarifies, include one concise NumPy block.\n",
    "4) 3 quick checks: increasing difficulty; give a hint first; reveal answers only after I try or ask.\n",
    "5) Assessment and feedback: Give me feedback on my performance - what I understood well, what needs improvement, and specific concepts to review further.\n",
    "6) Session reflection: Ask me for feedback on how the tutoring session went - what worked well, what could be improved, and if the pacing/difficulty was appropriate.\n",
    "7) Recap: a 60-second summary\n",
